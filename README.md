# Kibosh

An [open service broker](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker)
bridging the gap between Kubernetes deployments and CF marketplace.

When deployed with a Helm chart and added to the marketplace,
* `cf create-service` calls to Kibosh will create the collection of Kubernetes resources described by the chart.
* `cf bind-service` calls to Kibosh will expose back any services and secrets created by the chart

Overriding/Setting values as defined in values.yaml via 'cf create-service' or 'cf update-service'.  The format of the json string is a nested format.  Also refer to the cf cli for an example of a valid JSON object.

Example for setting the mysqlUser on `cf create-service` for the MySQL chart

values.yaml

```## Create a database user
##
# mysqlUser:
# mysqlPassword:
```

`cf create-service mysql medium mysql-kibosh-service -c '{"mysqlUser":"admin"}'`

Example for setting the resources.requests.memory on `cf update-service` for the MySQL chart

values.yaml

```## Configure resource requests and limits
## ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/compute-resources/
##
resources:
  requests:
    memory: 256Mi
    cpu: 100m
```

`cf update-service mysql-kibosh-service  -c '{"resources": {"requests": {"memory": "256Mi"}}}'`

For some in depth discussion, see this blog post:
[Use Kubernetes Helm Packages to Build Pivotal Cloud Foundry tiles](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/use-kubernetes-helm-packages-to-build-pivotal-cloud-foundry-tiles-kibosh-a-new-service-broker-makes-it-simple)

One consumer of this repo is
[tile-generator](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/tile-generator),
which provides a packaging abstraction to produce a PCF tile from a helm chart: we BOSH so you don't have to.
ISVs building out a tile should start there, rather than directly using this binary.
For documentation using Kibosh to build a tile, use the
[tile-generator documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/tile-generator.html#-helm-charts-with-kibosh)

We are still in early development, but do plan to provide migration for partners working directly with us.

## Configuration
### Changes required in Chart
* Plans (cf marketplace)
    Kibosh requires that helm chart has additional file that describes plan in `plans.yaml` at root level
    ```yaml
    - name: "small"
      description: "default (small) plan for mysql"
      file: "small.yaml"
    - name: "medium"
      description: "medium sized plan for mysql"
      file: "medium.yaml"
    ```
    `file` is a filename that exists in the `plans` subdirectory of the chart and
    `name`'s value should be lower alpha, numeric, `.`, or `-` 
    Values `values.yaml` sets the defaults. Each plan's yaml file is an set of values overriding the defaults present in `values.yaml`
    (copy any `values.yaml` key/value pairs to override into a new plan file)

In order to successfully pull private images, we're imposing some requirements
on the `values.yaml` file structure

* Single image charts should use this structure:
    ```yaml
    ---
    image: "my-image"
    imageTag: "5.7.14"
    ```
* Multi-image charts shoud use this structure:
    ```yaml
    ---
    images:
      thing1:
        image: "my-first-image"
        imageTag: "5.7.14"
      thing2:
        image: "my-second-image"
        imageTag: "1.2.3"
    ```

### Other Requirement

* When defining a `Service`, to expose this back to any applications that are bound,
  `type: LoadBalancer` is a current requirement.
   Alternatively set type: NodePort; Kibosh will add externalIPs and nodePort to bind json
* Resizing disks has limitiations. To support upgrade:
    - You can't resize a persistent volume claim (currently behind an [alpha feature gate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/feature-gates/))
* Selectors are [immutable](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#selector)
    - This means that *chart name cannot change* (the name is generally used in selectors)

### Private registries
When the environment settings for a private registry are present (`REG_SERVER`, `REG_USER`, `REG_PASS`), 
then Kibosh will transform images to pull them from the private registry. It assumes
the image is already present (see the Kibosh deployment). It will patch
the default service account in the instance namespaces to add in the registry credentials.

Be sure that `REG_SERVER` contains any required path information. For example, in gcp `gcr.io/my-project-name`

## Dev
#### Setup

Install Go depenencies
```bash
go get -u github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
go get -u github.com/onsi/gomega
go get -u github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter
go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep
go get -u github.com/gosuri/uitable
```

#### Run
Run `make bootstrap` from a clean checkout to setup initial dependencies. This will restore
the locked dependency set specified by `Gopkg.toml` (we're no longer checking in `vendor`).

Copy `local_dev.sh.template` to `local_dev.sh` (which is in `.gitignore`) and 
configure the values (`cluster.certificate-authority-data`, `cluster.server`, and `user.token`)
for a working cluster (minikube instructions below). Then run:

```bash
./local_dev.sh
```

#### Charts
The Kibosh code loads charts from the `HELM_CHART_DIR`, which defaults to `charts`.
This directory can either be a single chart (with all the changes described in the
configuration, eg `plans.yaml` and `./plans`), or, directory where each
subdirectory is a chart. The multiple charts feature isn't yet supported by tile-generator.
```
charts
├── mariadb
│   ├── Chart.yaml
    ├── plans
    │   ├── medium.yaml
    │   └── small.yaml
    ├── plans.yaml
    ├── templates
...
└── mysql
    ├── Chart.yaml
    ├── plans
    │   └── default.yaml
...
```

We have modified [some example charts](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/kibosh-sample/tree/master/sample-charts) from stable helm repository.
 
#### Test
```bash
make test
```

To generate the test-doubles, after any interface change run: 
```bash
make generate
```

### CI
* https://concourse.cfplatformeng.com/teams/main/pipelines/kibosh

The pipeline is backed by a cluster in the shared GKE account. The default admin
user in GKE has a password while Kibosh is configured to use a token. To create a user
in the cluster and fetch the token, do something like:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: kibosh-concourse-ci
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kibosh-concourse-ci
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: kibosh-concourse-ci
    namespace: kube-system
```

```bash
kubectl create -f [above contents in file].yml
kubectl get secrets --namespace=kube-system | grep "kibosh-concourse-ci"
kubectl get secret --namespace=kube-system kibosh-concourse-ci-token-pfnqs -o yaml
```

#### Dependency vendoring

To add a dependency:
```bash
dep ensure -add github.com/pkg/errors
```

To update a dependency:
```bash
dep ensure -update github.com/pkg/errors
```

Dependency vendoring with respect to helm & k8s is trickier. `dep` isn't able to build the
tree without significant help. The `Gopkg.tml` has several overrides needed to get everything
to compile.

Updating to a new version of helm/k8s will probably require re-visiting the override & constraint
matrix built. Useful inputs into this process are:
* The k8s Godeps
    - https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/Godeps/Godeps.json
* Helm's Glide dependencies and dependency lock file
    - https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/glide.yaml
    - https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/glide.lock
* Draft's `Gopkg.toml` file (they're doing the same thing we are, pulling in Helm as a library)
    - https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/kibosh
* This [helm tracker issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/issues/3031) also has some useful context

Also run the make target `cleandep` to wipe out the lock file an any local state when upgrading
helm/k8s, to make sure it can be rebuilt cleanly from the specified constraints.

* `Gopks.toml` details: https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/docs/Gopkg.toml.md

## Bazaar
Kibosh can also manage multiple charts more dynamically (without redeployment),
when configured differently, see
[lite-bazaar-manifest.yml](bosh/bosh-release/manifests/lite-bazaar-manifest.yml)

This allows customers to add any available helm chart to their cf marketplace with 
minimal effort and cycle time.

There is also a corresponding cli (`bazaarcli`) to manage these charts.

```bash
./bazaarcli.mac -t http://bazaar.v3.pcfdev.io -u admin -p 'monkey123' list
./bazaarcli.mac -t http://bazaar.v3.pcfdev.io -u admin -p 'monkey123' save ~/workspace/kibosh-sample/sample-charts/mysql-0.8.2.tgz
./bazaarcli.mac -t http://bazaar.v3.pcfdev.io -u admin -p 'monkey123' save ~/workspace/kibosh-sample/sample-charts/rabbitmq-1.1.9.tgz
./bazaarcli.mac -t http://bazaar.v3.pcfdev.io -u admin -p 'monkey123' list

cf enable-service-access mysql
cf enable-service-access rabbitmq
cf marketplace

./bazaarcli.mac -t http://bazaar.v3.pcfdev.io -u admin -p 'monkey123' delete rabbitmq
cf marketplace
```
